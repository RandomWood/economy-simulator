# Economy-Simulator
Source code of a Roblox revival which now has been shutdown 
# How to start the website?
This requires Linux or Windows + WSL. It might also work on Mac, but I haven't tried.

Postgresql (13+) and redis are required. If you're on windows, you will need to install WSL, and then install redis with WSL.

1. Create a PG user, DB, and create a file called "config.json" in services/api. Put this in it (replacing the DB, User, and Pass with your credentials):

{
    "knex": {
	"client": "pg",
        "connection": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "user": "postgres",
        "password": "postgres",
        "database": "db_name_here"
        }
    }
}

2. Install nodejs, go (lang), and dotnet 6. go into the services/api directory in a terminal, run "npm i", then run "npx knex migrate:latest".

3. Go into the services/Roblox/Roblox.Website folder and rename "appsettings.example.json" to "appsettings.json". Put in your DB info and any other configurable things. Also make sure to edit the "Directories" stuff (change "/home/my_username/source-code/" to the exact path of the unzipped source code, i.e. the path this README file is in)

4. Go into the "services/Roblox/Roblox.Website" folder in a terminal, and run "dotnet run". If everything is successful, you should be able to visit the site at "http://localhost:5000/".

5. Start up the "admin" service by opening a new terminal, going into the "services/admin" folder, and running "npm i" then "npm run dev".

6. Open "services/2016-roblox-main/docs/get-started.md" and follow the guide for setting up 2016-roblox (this is the frontend). You should change the "https://{0}.roblox.com{1}" api format to "http://localhost:5000/apisite/{0}{1}"

7. Register an account, then copy your user id and replace the "12" in "OwnerUserId" (inside appsettings) with your user id. ctrl+c the "dotnet run" command to close it, then run it again to start the site back up. You should now be able to go to "http://localhost:5000/admin/" for admin stuff.

8. In order to upload things, you will have to start up the "asset validation service". You can do this by going into "services/AssetValidationServiceV2" in a terminal and running "go run main.go".

Note that the "game-server" program will probably need a lot of edits to actually work as a game service and/or render service.
